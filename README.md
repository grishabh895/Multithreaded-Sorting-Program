# Multithreaded-Sorting-Program.
This is a Multithreaded-Sorting-Application, where quick sort, merge sort and insertion sort are used with pThread APIs. Here an array is divided into 2 parts and are sorted concurrently in two seperate threads. After sorting, the two threads are combined in a third thread and further results are displayed. Please read the report and presentation for more.
